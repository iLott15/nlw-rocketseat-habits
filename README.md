## ðŸ§ª Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

## ðŸ§ª SOLID

Principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a unique responsibility;
- Open/Closed Principle: Application classes must be open for extension but closed for modification;
- Liskov Substitution Principle: We should be able to replace a parent class with an inheritance from it and everything still works;
- Interface Segregation Principle: Segregate Interfaces;
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Instead of the class fetching the dependencies it needs, the context informs the class of the required dependencies;
